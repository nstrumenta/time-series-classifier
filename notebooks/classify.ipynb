        "# Synthetic Data Classification Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates the complete pipeline for magnetic distortion classification using synthetically generated sensor data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Process:\n",
        "1. **Generate Synthetic Data**: Create sensor data with different magnetic distortion levels\n",
        "2. **Create Spectrograms**: Convert time-series data to spectrograms for audio classification\n",
        "3. **Load Pre-trained Model**: Use a fine-tuned model for magnetic distortion detection\n",
        "4. **Classify Data**: Run inference on the generated synthetic data\n",
        "5. **Analyze Results**: View classification results and confidence scores\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features:\n",
        "- **Self-contained**: Generates its own test data - no external files needed\n",
        "- **Configurable**: Easy to adjust distortion levels and data characteristics\n",
        "- **Educational**: Shows the complete ML pipeline from data generation to classification\n",
        "- **Modular**: Uses the new modular architecture for clean, maintainable code\n",
        "\n",
        "## Configuration:\n",
        "- Set `DISTORTION_LEVEL` to test different magnetic distortion scenarios\n",
        "- Modify `DURATION_S` to generate longer or shorter test sequences\n",
        "- Adjust `MODEL_ID` to use different trained models"
